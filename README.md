  ## Hey, I’m Márcio Vinícius — welcome to my GitHub, dude 

I’m into everything tech, but what I really love is coding.

### A bit about me
I don’t stick to any specific language or framework — they’re just tools to solve real-world problems. 
So I focus more on the problems themselves, and use whatever tech gets the job done.


Right now, I’m working as a Fullstack Developer at [Exitlag](https://exitlag.com) — a platform that boosts game performance and connection using AI.

### What I'm hacking on
Aside from my day-to-day work as a developer, my main focus right now is learning and leveling up.<br>
I’m planning to start sharing more of what I’ve been building and documenting my journey as a developer soon.

Lately, I’ve been all about system programming, tool development, and network programming.
