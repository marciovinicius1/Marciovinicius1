  ## Hey, I’m Márcio Vinícius — welcome to my GitHub, dude 

I’m into everything tech, but what I really love is coding.

### A bit about me
I don’t stick to any specific language or framework — they’re just tools to solve real-world problems. 
So I focus more on the problems themselves, and use whatever tech gets the job done.

Lately, I’ve been all about system programming, tool development, and network programming.

Right now, I’m working as a Fullstack Developer at [Exitlag](exitlag.com) — a platform that boosts game performance and connection using AI.

### What I'm hacking on
Aside from my day-to-day work as a developer, my main focus right now is learning and leveling up.<br>
I’m planning to start sharing more of what I’ve been building and documenting my journey as a developer soon.
